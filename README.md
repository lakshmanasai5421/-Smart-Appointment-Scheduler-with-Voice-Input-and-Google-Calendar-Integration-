📅 Smart Appointment Scheduler
📝 Description
This is a simple Appointment Scheduler web application built using PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and Google Calendar integration. Users can enter appointment details manually or use voice input (speech-to-text) to fill in the details. The script extracts dates from the input, determines the reason for the appointment, and allows users to add the event to Google Calendar. Appointment details are also saved in a local file for future reference.
